But before we do that, note that the **pageTransition** files can also be used to create real and fake choices for the player. Below, the real choice is that you can go forward or you can return to T2.2.4. The fake choice is that clicking on either 'A' or 'B' leads you to exactly the same page (T2.3), without the player necessarily knowing it. You can find examples of this in the first pages of both the <a href=\"https://github.com/uzh/lit-demo/tree/master/trailer1/1.0.0\" class=\"underlined\" target=\"_blank\">trailer</a> and of *Plantation Lives*."
