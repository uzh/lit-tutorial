  "markdownContent": "To enjoy the power, which you've gained becoming a game-creator, you can create various criterias the player has to meet to progress from one page to another. One of these is for example giving the correct solution for an exercise, like you've seen on T1.2a and T1.2b. If you look at `pageTransition1.json` in T1.2a you'll see that the *exerciseCriteria* is *correctInput*. This means *Marugoto* will check if the player has solved the exercise based on the contents of *textSolutions* and only display the transition button once they've done so.<br><br>Another common criteria is a time limit for a player to spend on a task. You'll find an example for that in one of the first pages of *Plantation Lives*, titled *The Industrializing Atlantic*. On this page you have three minutes to write down your thoughts until the page automatically transitions to the next one. To achieve this you have to edit the `page.json`. To have for example a two minutes limit for the page, you have to set *time* to `{\"time\": 120}`. Notice the repetition of *time*. You can either have the timer visible or not visible by defining *timerVisible* to either *true* or *false*. Last you have to add a variable, which is normally not found on a regular page called *autoTransitionOnTimerExpiration*. Defining this as *true* will result in progressing to the next page once the timer has reached 0:00.<br><br>mailCriteria.<br><br>pageCriteria & visited/notVisited."
