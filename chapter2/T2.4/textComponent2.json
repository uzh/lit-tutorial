  "markdownContent": "If you've familiarized yourself with the 12 columns of *Marugoto*, you can even go so far and already define the values for *numberOfColumns*, *offsetColumns* and *renderOrder*. For the general structure of the game and branching, it's also really helpful to draw a tree for how the game should progress and which decisions a player can make. When you finished mapping out your game and the pages you can go into your repository and start editing the existing files. For the start the easiest way is to just edit the existing files in the folders. So for your first page you'd for example change the title of T1.1 in the `page.json`, delete the **videoComponent** and the **audioComponent** as you maybe don't need them and edit the **textComponents**. Then you'd change the the image shown by adding the one you want to display to the `resources` folder and referring to it in `imageComponent.json`. Congratulations, you've just created your first own *Lives in Transit*--page! These are the basic steps to get to results quickly.<br><br>Please be aware that after you transition off this page, you *can't* go back (the next page is the final page of this Tutorial)."
