  "markdownContent": "If you've familiarized yourself with the 12 columns of *Marugoto*, you can even go so far as to define the values for *numberOfColumns*, *offsetColumns* and *renderOrder*. For the general structure of the game and branching, it's also really helpful to draw a tree for how the game should progress and which decisions a player can make (or be blocked from making).<br><br>When you have finished mapping out your game-pages you can go into your repository and begin editing the existing files. At the start the easiest way is to just edit the existing files in the folders. So for your first page, for example, you'd change the title of T1.1 in the `page.json`, delete the **videoComponent** and the **audioComponent** (as you maybe don't need them) and edit the **textComponent** files. Then you'd change the image shown by adding the one you want to display to the `resources` folder and referring to it in `imageComponent.json`. And congratulations, you've just created your first own *Lives in Transit* page! These are the basic steps to get quick results on your local computer. Actually importing your game into our test environment (or creating your own) and then eventually deploying on the LiT website is more complicated: please read the “About” tab on the LiT homepage first and then be in contact with us.<br><br>Please be aware that after you transition off this page, you *can't* go back (the next page is the final page of this Tutorial)."
