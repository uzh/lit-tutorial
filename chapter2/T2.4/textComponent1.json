  "markdownContent": "To start creating your own *Lives in Transit*--Chapter you first of all want to clone the repository of an existing game, for example this <a href=\"https://github.com/uzh/lit-tutorial\" class=\"underlined\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial</a>. It's best to take a smaller game instead of for example *Plantation Lives* to keep an overview of what you're doing and facilitate finding bugs. Next we'd personally advice you to take a step back from the computer and start planning out your game on a piece a paper (or a text file if you do like to keep it digital). Note down the pages you want to create and the modules, which you'd like to have on them. It's also really useful to simply draw the pages to have a visual representation. The following image shows an example of how Martin Dusinberre has structured a part of *Plantation Lives*."
