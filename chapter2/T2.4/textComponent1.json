  "markdownContent": "To start creating your own *Lives in Transit* topic (that is, a game) you will first of all want to clone the repository of an existing game, for example this <a href=\"https://github.com/uzh/lit-tutorial\" class=\"underlined\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial</a>. It's best to take a smaller game instead of, say, *Plantation Lives* to keep an overview of what you're doing and to facilitate finding your inputting errors. Next, we'd personally advise you to step away from your computer and start planning out your game on a piece a paper (or a text file if you like to keep things digital---in which case you might want to step back to your computer). Note down the pages you want to create and the modules which you'd like to have in them (**imageComponent**, **textComponent**, etc). It's also really useful simply to draw the pages to have a visual representation. The photo below shows an example of how Martin Dusinberre sketched out chapter 4 of *Plantation Lives*, with the help of one of his long-suffering assistants (thanks, David A.!)."
