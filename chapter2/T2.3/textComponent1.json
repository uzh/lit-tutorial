The hierarchy for a repository goes as follows: *topic* --> *chapter* --> *page*. The *topic* folder is the first level of your repository and contains the `topic.json` file as well as all chapters. For this tutorial it's *lit-tutorial*. The file `topic.json` allows you to define the title of your storyline, the preview image for the game selection and the page at which the storyline starts. Take a look at it <a href=\"https://github.com/uzh/lit-tutorial/blob/master/topic.json\" class=\"underlined\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>: most of it should be easy to understand by now. To keep your storyline well structured, it's best to divide the pages into different thematic chapters. This tutorial has two chapters, the first discussing the possible contents of a page and the second regarding page transitions, structure and general information. Each of these chapter folders must have its own `chapters.json`, which defines the title of the chapter and the logo you can see in the top left corner. On the lowest level there are the page folders, which contain the files comprising each page. You should be familiar with them by now. For a page to exist there must be, at the very minimum, a `page.json` and one `pageTransition.json`. Keep this in mind if you want to start creating the basic structure of your game without filling in the contents.<br><br>The following page will discuss a basic workflow to get you ready for creating your own storyline!"
