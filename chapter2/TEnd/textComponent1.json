In the case of this Tutorial it's the page TEnd, which you'll see in action when you click on the button, *Go to your games*, below. It essentially works like a normal page, except for two things: first, in the `page.json` the value for the variable *endOfTopic* is *true*; and, second, there is no **pageTransition** file. This means that the *buttonText* below is generated by your change to the **page** file; and it will take you back to the *Your games* page, where your game will be listed under *Finished Games* (and where you can download your Notebook as a PDF). <br><br>If you're interested in the complete functionality of *Marugoto*, be sure to check out the <a href=\"https://lives-in-transit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" class=\"underlined\" target=\"_blank\">writers' guide</a> (under development). If you find bugs or errors, pull requests are always welcome (see our “Bug Bounty Programme” on the LiT frontpage). Please be in touch via <a href=\"https://github.com/uzh/marugoto\" class=\"underlined\" target=\"_blank\">via GitHub</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/transitlives\" class=\"underlined\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.<br><br>That's it! Now you should be able to start creating your own *Lives in Transit* game. Good luck, and have fun!"
