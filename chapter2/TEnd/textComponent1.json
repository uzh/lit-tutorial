In the case of the tutorial it's the page TEnd, you'll find in the repository or when you click on the button *Finish the tutorial* below. It essentially works like a normal page, except in the `page.json` the value for the variable *endOfTopic* is true. This will cause a button to appear which says *Go to your games* and brings the player back to the starting screen.<br><br>If you're interested in the complete functionality of *Marugoto*, be sure to check out the <a href=\"https://lives-in-transit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" class=\"underlined\" target=\"_blank\">writers' guide</a>.
