  "markdownContent": "The most common exercise is a **textExercise**, as on this page. We've already come across **textExercises** before (p. T1.2a), when it was impossible for the player to transition unless they had inputted a minimum of 300 characters. Here, the *buttonText* will only become visible if the player correctly transcribes the following sentence: **This is an extremely interesting transcription exercise.** If the player completes this exercise correctly, the *buttonText* will show, because you will have set the *exerciseCriteria* to *correctInput* and the *affectedExercise* to `chapter2/T2.2.4/textExercise1.json`<br><br>Note that in the *textSolutions* variable of the **textExercise** file, the *minLength* sub-variable (p. T1.2a) is now *null*, and the *mode* is *fuzzyComparison*. The other *modes* which you can input here are *contains*, and *fullMatch*. These differences (from *contains* as the easiest, to *fullMatch* as the most difficult, with *fuzzyComparison* inbetween) are hopefully self-explanatory.<br><br>For a **dateExercise** file, the principle is the same: the *criteria* variables which need to be inputted in your **pageTransition** file are *exerciseCriteria* and *affectedExercise*. There are also other kinds of exercise which you can set the player, including **checkboxExercise** and **radioButtonExercise**, but you can find examples of these for yourself in *Plantation Lives*."
