  "markdownContent": "Ironically, one of the most simple ways of forcing a page transition on the player concerns not the **pageTransition** files but rather the **page** file. Here, one can use the *time* variable to set a time limit for a particular page. On this page, we've set it at 120 seconds, and if you look at the top right of the screen, you can see the clock counting you down (in minutes). The reason you can see the clock is because of another variable, *timerVisible*, which we've set to *true*. (If you set it to *false*, the player would have no idea how long they have to complete a task.) Finally, we've set the *autoTransitionOnTimerExpiration* to *true*: this means that *Marugoto* will force an automatic transition to whatever page is defined as *to* in the **pageTransition** file. (Even if the player has their Inbox or Notebook open, *Marugoto* will force the page transition.)<br><br>You may want to have a situation where you force a player to transition. You may also want them to have a choice: if they have, say, five minutes to complete a task, they will be automatically transitioned after five minutes; but if they complete the task before time is up, they can trigger the transition themselves. The key here is the variable *buttonText* in the **pageTransition** file, to which we turn next. Here, you can give the player the option of transitioning in their own time, if you don't want to wait for the automatic transition. (You can return to T2.1 and test these transitions all over again on the following page.)"
