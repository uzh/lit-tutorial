  "markdownContent": "These three variables---*numberOfColumns*, *offsetColumns*, *renderOrder*---are part of every module you create on a page except **pageTransitions**. The image you see above this text relates to `imageComponent1.json`. If you look at the file in the repository, you'll see that there are other variables compared to the **textComponent** file. To use **imageComponent** you have to tell *Marugoto* which image it should display by defining the path to it. In this case it's the image `T_Coffee.jpg`, which you can find in the Tutorial game's resources folder. Then, below the variable *images*, you can add a caption to the image (within the set of double quotation marks). Similarly, if you look at the video and the audio modules below, and their relating `videoComponent1.json` and `audioComponent1.json` files in the repository, you'll see that they essentially work the same way. The video even has a hyperlink in the caption---and this is possible for image captions too. Only in the **audioComponent** files is it not possible for you to insert a caption.<br><br>And that's basically it: you have just learned the principles of page content in *Marugoto*. By clicking on the button below you will transition to the next topic: **textExercise** and **dateExercise** (we'll cover **pageTransition** files later)."
