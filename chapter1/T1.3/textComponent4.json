You can do this yourself now, to try it out. But note (as it were) that your input won't be saved until you transition to the next page. After you do so, your entry will be time-stamped, giving the player another marker of how his/her thoughts are developing as they progress through the storyline.</p><p>2. the Notebook functionality is especially useful if you have a longer storyline like *Plantation Lives*. It allows you, the game-creator, to build connections between earlier and later parts of your game."
